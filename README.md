# my-first-node-package

Throughout this assignment we've used NPM Package and Node Module as if they are the same, while there are similarities, how do they differ from one another?

They are both js packages, node you use to install Node Module, node module has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope.

If you create a new Node Module, how do you share that code with the community?
In the package.json
